This app was created for an iOS Development course offered at the University of Iowa. iTask is an interactive to-do list that will alert you of a task you want to complete when you are within the vicinity of a task. 

For example, if you wanted to buy dog food, you'd enter the task and locations you are interested in, and when you are in the area of oen of those places, the phone will send you a notification!

Very cool huh?
